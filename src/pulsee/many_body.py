def partial_trace(operator: Qobj, subspaces_dimensions: list, index_positions: int):
    """
    Legacy wrapper for pulsee.many_body.ptrace_subspace.

    Parameters
    ----------

    - operator: Qobj
                Operator to be sliced through the partial trace operation.
    - subspaces_dimensions: list
                            List of the dimensions of the subspaces whose direct sum is the Hilbert space where operator acts.
    - index_position: int
                      Indicates the subspace over which the partial trace of operator is to be taken by referring to the corresponding position along the list subspace_dimensions.

    Returns
    -------
    There are 3 possibilities:
    1. If operator belongs to type DensityMatrix, the function returns a DensityMatrix object representing the desired partial trace;
    2. If operator belongs to type Observable, the function returns a Observable object representing the desired partial trace;
    3. Otherwise, the function returns a generic Operator object representing the desired partial trace.

def ptrace_subspace(operator: Qobj, subspaces_dimensions: list, index_position: int):
    """
    Returns the partial trace of an operator over the specified subspace of the Hilbert space.
    Different from QuTip.Qobj.ptrace() in that it *traces over* the given subspace as opposed to *keeping* the given subspace.
    To trace over all subspaces but the given subspace, use QuTiP partial trace implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------

    - operator: Qobj
                Operator to be sliced through the partial trace operation.
    - subspaces_dimensions: list
                            List of the dimensions of the subspaces whose direct sum is the Hilbert space where operator acts.
    - index_position: int
                      Indicates the subspace over which the partial trace of operator is to be taken by referring to the corresponding position along the list subspace_dimensions.
