    Sets up the nuclear system under study, returning the objects representing
    the spin (either a single one or a multiple spins' system), the unperturbed

    Parameters

    spin_par : dict / list of dict
        Map/list of maps containing information about the nuclear spin/spins under
        consideration. The keys and values required to each dictionary in this
        argument are shown in the table below.

        |       'gamma/2pi'      |         float        |

        The second item is the gyromagnetic ratio over 2 pi, measured in MHz/T.

        the quadrupole term of the Hamiltonian (to be provided in MHz), 'asymmetry

        |       'phi_z'       |       float      |
        |  'field magnitude'  |  positive float  |

        |         'B'         |       float      |

        where A, B are constant of the hyperfine interaction inthe secular
        approximation, see paper.

        When it is None, the hyperfine interaction in the secular approximation
        between two spins is not taken into account.      Default value is None.

        Rank-2 tensor describing a two-spin interaction of the form

    Parameters
    ----------
    spin : NuclearSpin
        Spin under study.

    h_unperturbed : List[Qobj] or List[(Qobj, function)]
        Hamiltonian of the nucleus at equilibrium (in MHz).

    dm_initial : Qobj
        Density matrix of the system at time t=0, just before the application
        of the pulse.

    solver : string
             OR
             function: (Qobj, Qobj, ndarray, **kwargs) -> qutip.solver.Result
        Solution method to be used when calculating time evolution of
        state. If string, must be either `mesolve` or `magnus.`

    mode : Pulses
        Pulses dataclass that contains the following information -

        |index|'frequency'|'amplitude'| 'phase' |'theta_p'|'phi_p'|'pulse_time'|'shape' |'sigma'|
        |-----|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|-------|------------|--------|-------|

        where the meaning of each column is analogous to the corresponding
        parameters in h_single_mode_pulse.

        Theta is the polar angle (away from the z axis) of the pulse.
        So theta=pi/2 (default) corresponds to a pulse in the transverse plane,
        and theta=0 would correspond to a pulse in the z-direction (a very rare case).

        Phi is the azimuthal angle of the pulse.
        Phi=0 corresponds to a pulse in the x direction (in the rotating frame).
        Phi=pi/2 corresponds to a pulse in the y direction.

        Important: The amplitude value is B_1, not 2*B_1. The code will
        automatically multiply by 2!

        When it is None, the evolution of the system is performed for the
        given time duration without any applied pulse.

        The default value is None.

    evolution_time : float
        Duration of the evolution (in microseconds).

        The user will specify this argument only when they wish to evolve the
        state longer than the longest pulse's duration.

        The default value is 0 but will be updated to either the user's input
        or the duration of the longest pulse in `mode`, whichever is bigger.

    picture : string
        Sets the dynamical picture where the density matrix of the system
        is evolved for the `magnus` solver. May take the values:
            1.'IP', which sets the interaction picture;
            2.'RRF' (or anything else), which sets the picture corresponding to a
            rotating reference frame whose features are specified in argument
            RRF_par.

        The default value is 'IP'. For LAB frame, use picture='RRF' and
        give no RRF_par.
        The choice of picture has no effect on solvers other than `magnus`.

    RRF_par : dict
        Specifies the properties of the rotating reference frame where
        evolution is carried out when picture='RRF.' The
        keys and values required to this argument are shown in the table below:
        |      key      |  value  |
        |      ---      |  -----  |
        |'nu_RRF' (MHz) |  float  |
        |  'theta_RRF'  |  float  |
        |   'phi_RRF'   |  float  |
        where 'nu_RRF' is the frequency of rotation of the RRF (in MHz), while
        'theta_RRF' and 'phi_RRF' are the polar and azimuthal angles of the normal
        to the plane of rotation in the LAB frame (in radians).
        By default, all the values in this map are set to 0 (RRF equivalent
        to the LAB frame).

    times : list or np.array
        Pass in the array of times that the numerical calculation are performed for.
        Default is None.

    n_points : float
        The number of points sampled in the discrete approximation of the
        time-dependent Hamiltonian of the system. i.e. The length of the time array
        Default value is 1000.

    order : int
        The order of the simulation method to use. For `magnus` must be <= 3.
        Defaults to 1 for `magnus` and 12 for `mesolve` and any other solver.

    opts : dict
        A dictionary containing options that will be passed into qutip's `mesolve` function.
        Default is None

    return_allstates : boolean
        Specify whether to return every calculated state or only last one.
        Default False --> returns only last state.
        [Magnus solver only returns final state]

    display_progress: bool
        Whether to display progress bar for the mesolve method.
        Default is True

    Action
    ------
    If
    - evolution_time=0 AND mode=None, or
    - dm_initial is very close to the identity
      (with an error margin of 1e-10 for each element):
        the function returns dm_initial without performing any evolution.

    Otherwise,
    evolution is carried out in the picture determined by the
    same-named parameter. The evolution operator is built up appealing to the
    Magnus expansion of the full Hamiltonian of the system (truncated to the
    order specified by the same-named argument).

    Note:
    QuTiP should be the preferred solver.

    Magnus works best if each pulse is evaluated individually because it is dependent on the
    time array. Advised  not use evolution_time with magnus,  rather call another instance
    of the evolve function.

    Returns
    -------
    The Qobj representing the state of the system (in the
    Schrödinger picture) evolved through a time pulse_time under the action of
    the specified pulse.

    Evolve the given density matrix with the interactions given by the provided
    Hamiltonian using exact diagonalization.

    ipyparallel must be present for Jupyter notebooks.

    Params
    ------
    h : Qobj or List[Qobj]:
        The Hamiltonian describing the system in MHz.
    rho0 : Qobj
        The initial state of the system as a density matrix.
    spin : NuclearSpin
        The NuclearSpin object representing the system under study.
    tlist : List[float]
        List of times at which the system will be evolved.
    e_ops : List[Qobj]:
        List of operators for which to return the expectation values.
    state : Bool
        Whether to return the density matrix at all. Default `True`.
    fid : Bool
        Whether to return the free induction decay (FID) signal as
        an expectation value. If True, appends FID signal to the end of
        the `e_ops` expectation value list.
    par : Bool
        Whether to use QuTiP's parallel computing implementation `parallel_map`
        to evolve the system.
    all_t : Bool
        Whether to return the density matrix and for all times in the
        evolution (as opposed to the last state)
    T2 : float, or
         iterable[float], or
         function with signature (float) -> float, or
         iterable[function with signature (float) -> float]

        If float, characteristic time of relaxation of the component of the
        magnetization on the plane of detection vanishing, i.e., T2. It is
        measured in
        microseconds.

        If function, the decay envelope.

        If iterable, total decay envelope will be product of decays in list.

        Default value is 100 (microseconds).

    Returns
    ------
    [0]: The density matrix at time `tlist[-1]` OR the evolved density matrix
        at times specified by `tlist`.

    [1]: the expectation values of each operator in `e_ops` at the times in
        `tlist`. The latter is in the format `[[e_op1[t1], e_op1[t2], ...] ,
        [e_op2[t1], e_op2[t2]], ..., [e_opn[t1], e_opn[t2], ...]]`.

    OR

    The expectation values of each operator in `e_ops` at the times in `tlist`.
